Advanced jQuery
	 There are a bunch of ways to add event listeners to an html document.

	 here are some big ones:

		 click()

		 	quick and easy way to add a click listener to a given html element. it uses css selectors. so it would look like this:


			 	$("#submit").click(function(){
			 		some function stuff
			 	})

			 this code will select the html element with the id submit, and have it execute that anonomous function on the click event.

		 keypress()

		 	adds an element that listens for a keypress on a keyboard. using the following code you can return information about the key being pressed:

		 		$("input").keypress(function(event){
		 			return event.which
		 		})

		 		every keyboard input has an associated keycode. Here is a helpful website for firguing out the keycode:
		 		http://keycode.info/
		 		Honestly though, i could probably program a website that does exactly this knowing the logic up there. So im going to do that.

		 on()

		 	works similary to addEventListener, you have to specify what you are listening for, and then a function for what to do when that event takes place. check out the example code:

		 		$('button').on('dblclick', function(){
		 			alert("DOUBLE CLICKED!");
		 		});

		 		in the above code, an event listener is added to the button field using the on method. it is listening for a double click event. you could use 'click' or 'keypress' or whatever.


	Other Thoughts:
		this this. shortcut doesnt work in jquery, as jquery does not know by default to reference the var passed in the argument of a jquery function. Just use $(this) if you want to use that shortcut in a jquery function.
