	Data returned from an api is usualy contained in XML or JSON files

		var request = require('request');
			request('http://www.google.com', function (error, response, body) {
			  console.log('error:', error); // Print the error if one occurred
			  console.log('statusCode:', response && response.statusCode); // Print the response status code if a response was received
			  console.log('body:', body); // Print the HTML for the Google homepage.
			});
