Intro to API's

	Lets connect with other applications! Stands for Application Program Interface, You worked with them at allcovered building the bitdefender installation scripts!

	ifttt.com chain together apis!


	Data returned from an api is usualy contained in XML or JSON files

	we can use api jsons and xmls by setting a variable using the require("request") (the request module needs to be added to your node server to do so) commmand check this out:

		var request = require('request');
			request('http://www.google.com', function (error, response, body) {
			  console.log('error:', error); // Print the error if one occurred
			  console.log('statusCode:', response && response.statusCode); // Print the response status code if a response was received
			  console.log('body:', body); // Print the HTML for the Google homepage.
			});

	Looks like the api used in lecture 240 recent went private. Use the following key to access it:

		General search: http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=guardians+of+the+galaxy&apikey=thewdb 

		Search with Movie ID: http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198&apikey=thewdb 

		So everything is exactly the same as Colt explains in the following videos, except you must append &apikey=thewdb to the end of your url.

	side note: when creating a server instance, you can just install your dependencies all in one command like, 

		npm install --save express ejs request
