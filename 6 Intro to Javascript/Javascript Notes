Evalute js using the developer console

list the 5 JS primitives

Define variables with the var keyword

Write code using console.log, alert and prompt


5 primitive datatypes
	//numbers
		4 (whole numbers)
		9.3 (fractional)
		-10 (negative)
			You can do math, / * - + %(modulous)
				
				the % just finds the remainder of a value devided 		by another value
					10 % 3 = 1
					20%5=0

				javascript observes order of operations so
					(2*3)+6=12
	
	//strings
		"hello World"
		"43"  -- inside of quotes
			Just anything in quotes
				can use '' or "" so long as they match on each side

				You can add strings "hi" + " goodbye" = "hi goodbye"

				\ is a escape character, so we can include synatax inside of a string

				If you want to include \ inside a quote just have two backslashes and it will print out as 1 backslash

		All strings ahve a length property.
			"hello".length = 5

		You can return a certain value from from a string by using []
			"hello"[1] = e
			numbers in the bracket will return the nth value of the string

	//Booleans
		True
		False

	//Null and undefined
		null
		undefined

			something that is undefinied, like a variable with no established value
				For example if you used the following code, and asked for favorite color, it would return undefined

				var color = "red";
				var favoritecolor;

			Something that is null is a a value explicitly set to nothing, not something that is not definied.



Quick Exercises
	100 % 3 = 1

	("blah" + "blah")[6]
		(blahblah)[6]
			a

	"hello".length % "hi\\".length
		5 % 3
			2

Variables
	Is a container for one of those primitive types, and lets us recall it later

		var yourVariableName = yourValue;

	Vars can change
		var name = stu;
		var name = stumoney
			the var is now stumoney

	var num = 43;
		num + 100 = 143

		the nomenclature of variables is camelCase, where you don't capitalize the first word in variable, but each additional word is capitalized
			var thisIsAnExample = "buttz";

Methods are peices of premade code
	methods we know so far...
		clear()
			clears the console

		alert()
			passes primitive data to the user in the form of a little pop up

				alert("hello chubbs")
					would pop up with the string hello chubbs

		console.log()
			prints something to the console (users would not normally see it)

		prompt("")
			Brings up a window that prompts for information that when entered, will return that value in the console
				for example:
					var userName = prompt("What is your name?");

					will set the userName variable to whatever the user types into that field
