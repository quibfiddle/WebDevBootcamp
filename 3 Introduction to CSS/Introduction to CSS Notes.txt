Color hex values

#000000
	the first 2 digits are the Red, the second 2 is the Green, and the Last two digits is the blue. HOLY SHIT

Color can also be done with rgb

	H1 {
	color: rgb(r,g,b)
	}

	Where r g and b are values between 0 and 255

		RGBA adds a 4th channel, alpha or transparency, ranging between 0.0 and 1.0

Background, can be applied to elements to give it a background
	h4 {
	background: rgb();
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-size: cover;
	}

Borders have three main components
	Width
	color
	style
		solid
		dash

	Border: 5px solid purple:

Three big selectors
	Element

		referencing it in the CSS to style it
		#name {
		
		}
	Class
		Giving a set of html elements a general identifier so that they call be styled in a similar way
		.name {
		
		}
