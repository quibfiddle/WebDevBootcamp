Rendering HTML and Templates

	Use res.render() to render HTML
		used to respond with a payload, like html file or an embedded javascript file. res.render looks in the view folder in the same directory of the webpage

		res.render("dogs.ejs");

	Explain what EJS is why we use it

		Ejs allows us to populate an html file with variable items for dynamic content


	Pass Variables to EJS templates

		so using variables in ejs looks like this; establish the variable in your javascript:

			var thing = req.params.thing;
			//the payload getting sent back from that request
			res.send(index.ejs, {thingVar: thing});

		then in your EJS file you can have text be treated as javascript when you close it in the right brackets, like so:

			<h1> Oh snap its: <%= thingVar %></h1>
