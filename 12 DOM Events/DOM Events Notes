DOM Events
	Events can be everywhere; clicking on a button, hovering over a link, dragging and dropping pressing a key.

	We select an element and then add an event listenr to that element

		"listen for a click on <button>"

		"Listen for a hover event on the <h1>"

	To do this we use the method called addEventListener

		element.addEventListener(type, functionToCall);

	Look at its use in the following code:

		HTML

			<button>Click Me</button>
			<p>No One Has Clicked Me Yet</p>

		JS

			var button = document.querySelector("button");
			var paragraph = document.querySelector("p");

		button.addEventListener("click", function(){
			paragraph.textContent = "Someone Clicked the Button!";
		})

	So a quick recap of what this code does: The querySelector method us used to assign button and paragraph variables, and then the event listener is added to the button variable, which listens for a click. Once that takes place, the Do of the event listener takes place, which changes the paragraph.textContent value to "someone CLicked the Button!
