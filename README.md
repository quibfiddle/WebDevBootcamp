WebDevBootcamp

	My Notes and projects for each section of this awesome course:

	The notes for the first couple sections are not too great, or there at all. They do get better around 3 and forward however.

	Quick note!

	 In the git, the lessons are listed numerically, but that number does not correlate to the lesson number in the syllabus, the numbers I use starting at at 1, is actually lesson 3 in the syllabus.
